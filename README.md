## 💡 The Problem
Current AI image generation relies on "Prompt Engineering"—guessing magic words to get a specific camera angle or lighting setup. For professionals in [industry, e.g., e-commerce/filmmaking], this is inefficient. They don't need "magic," they need **control**.

## 🚀 The Solution
**[Project Name]** creates a deterministic, production-ready workflow using **Bria FIBO**. Instead of text prompts, we use [describe your method, e.g., UI sliders / Logic Agents] to generate structured JSON payloads.

This allows users to:
1.  **Stop Guessing:** Control specific parameters like `camera_angle`, `fov`, and `lighting` directly.
2.  **Scale Up:** Generate consistent assets across thousands of iterations.
3.  **Stay Safe:** Leverage Bria's commercially licensed dataset for enterprise compliance.

## 🛠️ How We Used FIBO (The "Secret Sauce")
This project is built entirely around FIBO's **JSON-Native Architecture**. We bypass standard text-to-image randomness by constructing strict JSON objects.

**Key Technical Implementation:**
* **Structured Inputs:** We map user intents directly to FIBO's parameter schema.
* **Disentanglement:** We use the API to change the *subject* (e.g., "Shoe") while keeping the *style* (e.g., "Studio Lighting") mathematically identical.

### Example JSON Payload Generated by our Tool:
```json
{
  "prompt": "A futuristic sneaker",
  "parameters": {
    "camera_angle": "low_angle",
    "fov": "wide",
    "lighting_style": "cinematic",
    "color_palette": ["#FF5733", "#C70039"],
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
  }
}
